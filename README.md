# Learn-cpp

This repository is used for tracking my personal progress through the [LearnCPP](https://www.learncpp.com/) resources, which I am doing to refresh my C++ knowledge.

You should not expect any high-quality, well-documented or well-structured repository. This is purely for my own personal progress.

## Compilation

The command I ussed for all compilation is:

```bash
clang++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++2b -Wpedantic -o a.out <file>
```
